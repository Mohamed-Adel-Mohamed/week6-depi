During Session 11 and 12 of the Digital Pioneers (DEPI) program, I gained valuable insights into ethical hacking and penetration testing. I learned how to create an Ethical Hacking Policy, emphasizing confidentiality, authorization, and reporting. Additionally, I explored tools like Burp Suite, Metasploit, and Nmap on Kali Linux, performing reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning tasks. These sessions enriched my skills in the Penetration Testing Track, reinforcing ethical practices and hands-on proficiency with essential tools.
